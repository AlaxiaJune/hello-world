# hello-world
Look at me learning this GitHub thing!

I am a student in the Coursera/Google Data Analysis certificate program.  So far, I've completed the first five week course over a span of two weeks and finished the first week of the second course in one day.  I'm not even hiding this in a humble brag here because so far it's coming naturally and I'm just really excited about it!  I'm kind of just devouring the material. Om nom nom!
