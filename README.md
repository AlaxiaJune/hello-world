# hello-world
Look at me learning this GitHub thing!

I am a student in the Coursera/Google Data Analysis certificate program.  While it's a six month program, I'm hoping to complete it in three to four months time so I can dive into the workforce.  I managed to complete the first course in the program in two weeks instead of five, so I'm feeling confident; however, I know that taking the time to fully learn SQL, Python, and R will probably be slower points in the journey.  However, I'm just really excited about it!  I'm kind of just devouring the material. Om nom nom!
