# hello-world
Look at me learning this GitHub thing!

I am a data analyst who earned a professional certificate in data analytics from Google.  I update my learning log somewhat regularly (mostly) in order to see the progress I've made and show off the skills I'm learning.  You can check that out for a summary of my skills and confidence level!
